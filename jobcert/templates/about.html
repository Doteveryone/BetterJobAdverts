            We can use technology and open standards to make the job market better in the UK.

        <h3>What's are the problems?</h3>

            <a href="https://blogs.citizensadvice.org.uk/blog/job-adverts-how-getting-the-small-details-right-can-lead-to-big-successes/">Citizens Advice research</a> has shown that job adverts in the UK are very poor quality. Information like salaries, geographical location, skills needed are unclear and inconsistent.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is <a href="http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/about">some evidence</a> that 'gender coded language' in job adverts may influence if applicants feel they 'belonged' in that occupation.

            <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmpubacc/154/154.pdf">Half of the UK working population have a reading age of 11-years-old or younger</a>. Badly written or hard to understand job adverts make it harder for people to apply for them.
          </li>
          <li>Unclear copyright status of job adverts and lack of structured data stifles reuse and innovation.</li>
        </ul>
