<h2>About this site</h2>

<p>Job hunters want great services to find jobs - ones that
list every job there is, with accurate up to date details, and
alerts when new ones appear.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this isn't possible because employers and job sites publish
very low quality job adverts. Salaries, geographical location, skills needed
are unclear and inconsistent. They can't be easily reused by other sites
and apps.</p>

<p>There is an international standard (called <a href="https://schema.org/JobPosting">
  schema.org JobPosting</a>) for publishing job adverts with proper
data. Open Jobs checks a jobs website to see if it is using that standard. We
award Gold, Silver and Bronze grades to sites which pass.
</p>

<h2>To do</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Put in cert images
    <li>Publish to public URL
    <li>Press return
</ul>
