<h2>About this site</h2>

<p>Having lots of jobs on one website, and making it easy to search
them is really important. So are alerts, to you can get notified on 
your phone when there is a new job.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, employers and jobs sites publish very low quality
job adverts. Salaries, geographical location, skills needed are 
unclear and inconsistent.</p>

<p>There is an international standard (called <a href="https://schema.org/JobPosting">
  schema.org JobPosting</a>) for publishing job adverts with proper
data. This site can check a jobs website to see if it is using that
standard.
</p>

<h2>To do</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Decide on image cert format
    <li>Error handling - e.g. not a URL
    <li>Remove default
    <li>Nice theme
</ul>
